What is Chrome Canary and why should I use it?
Chrome Canary is the developer version of Chrome. It looks and acts like the regular 
Chrome browser, but it includes new and experimental features that haven't been released yet. 
We recommend analyzing websites with Canary to take advantage of the latest tech. However, 
be warned that Canary isn't guaranteed to be stable, so expect crashes and occasional bugs.

Do I have to test on mobile?
For the purposes of this course, no. But testing your websites on mobile is a best practice, 
and if you have the means to do so we highly recommend it.
